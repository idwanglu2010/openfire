Some of the files here, notably libjitsi.jar, are OSGi bundles from the Jitsi
project. In Jitsi they are generated in the 'sc-bundles' directory by the
'bundles' ant target. To update the files here, run 'ant rebuild' in Jitsi and
then copy the files, e.g.:
for i in *; do
  if [ -e ../../jitsi/sc-bundles/$i ]; then
    cp ../../jitsi/sc-bundles/$i .; 
    fi;
done
